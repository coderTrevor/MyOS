This project is currently "Duct-Von-Taped" together. I've utilized many references and snippets of code to get it this far.
It's not my intention to claim all of this work as my own. Rather the OS, in it's entirety, is "mine" in the sense that it
accomplishes what I want it to (or part of what I want it to, anyway). In this file, I'll attempt to keep track of some of
the many sources I've used, both for code snippets and referential reading. This is, of course, not an exhaustive list,
and I may even leave out some of the places I've copied code from. Sorry if I leave your code out! Again, it's not my
intention to claim code I haven't written as my own, but in the interest of getting my OS up and running as soon as possible,
it seems silly to rewrite perfectly good code I've found on the net. "No copyright infringement intended."

I struggled a lot to get GDT working properly with MSVC. (I almost think the OSDev wiki does more harm than good here, but _after_
you already understand the concept, it is useful).
Here's some of the GDT references, tutorials, and random tidbits I used:

commands I've used to launch QEMU:
C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects\MyOS_1\Debug>"c:\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-x86_64w.exe" -boot n -device e1000,netdev=n1 -netdev user,id=n1,tftp=c:\users\Administrator\.VirtualBox\TFTP

"C:\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-x86_64w.exe" -device vmware-svga -netdev user,id=u1 -device rtl8139,netdev=u1 -kernel "C:\users\Administrator\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects\MyOS_1\Debug\MyOS_1.dll" -object filter-dump,id=f1,netdev=u1,file="C:\Program Files\qemu\dump.dat"
